# Latest Activity - Thai Talent WOW ML Model

## 2025-09-09

### Cleaned Up Misunderstood Work
- Removed unnecessary PostgreSQL integration files that were created but not needed
- Removed multiple GCS loader variations that were confusing
- Kept only the essential `config/gcs_data_loader.py` for date-partitioned data loading
- Deleted failed `retention-trigger-api` service that had Docker platform issues

### Created Retention Pipeline Trigger Integration
- **Added retention trigger endpoints to existing `talent-analytics` service**
- Modified `vertex_ai/secure_api.py` to include retention pipeline functionality
- This integrates with the REAL retention pipeline in `predictive_retention/main.py`
- Complete ML workflow: Feature Engineering → Model Training → Model Saving → Predictions → Results → Visualization

### New API Endpoints (in talent-analytics service)
- `POST /trigger-retention-pipeline` - Triggers the complete retention pipeline
- `GET /retention-job-status/{job_id}` - Checks status of a running job  
- `GET /retention-jobs` - Lists all pipeline jobs

### Working Service
**URL**: https://talent-analytics-689036726654.asia-southeast1.run.app/
**Authentication**: X-API-Key header (demo keys: `demo-key-2024`, `th-talent-prod-key`)

### Working Test Commands
```bash
# Trigger retention pipeline
curl -X POST https://talent-analytics-689036726654.asia-southeast1.run.app/trigger-retention-pipeline \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: demo-key-2024" \
  -d '{"gcs_date_partition": "2025-09-05"}'

# Check job status  
curl https://talent-analytics-689036726654.asia-southeast1.run.app/retention-job-status/{job_id} \
  -H "X-API-Key: demo-key-2024"

# List all jobs
curl https://talent-analytics-689036726654.asia-southeast1.run.app/retention-jobs \
  -H "X-API-Key: demo-key-2024"
```

### Status
- **Code implemented** - Retention trigger endpoints added to secure_api.py
- **Service cleaned** - Removed broken retention-trigger-api service  
- **Integration ready** - Uses existing working deployment infrastructure
- **Successfully deployed** - talent-analytics service updated with retention endpoints
- **Fully tested** - All retention endpoints working correctly

### Key Files
- `vertex_ai/secure_api.py` - Updated with retention endpoints  
- `predictive_retention/main.py` - The actual retention ML pipeline (existing)
- `config/gcs_data_loader.py` - GCS data loader for date-partitioned data

### Notes
- Retention functionality integrated into existing `talent-analytics` service (better than separate service)
- Uses same authentication system and deployment infrastructure
- Pipeline will run in background to avoid blocking API
- Only one pipeline can run at a time to prevent resource conflicts
- GCS date partition configurable via API parameter
